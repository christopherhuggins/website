This project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council as part of the [UK in a Changing Europe initiative](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexitresearch/uk-fisheries-policy-post-brexit-multi-level-challenges-and-opportunities/), and led by Dr Craig McAngus at the University of the West of Scotland.

This project will look at the different levels of government in the UK in the context of fisheries policy. Using fisheries as a case study, the project aims to contribute to the academic literature on multi-level governance and rescaling by exploring the need to alter policy realities in a post Brexit UK.

Besides examining the UKâ€™s internal dynamics, the project aims to look overseas to Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands; states and territories who are outside the EU but who govern their own territorial waters and who negotiate with each other and the EU every year to set the amount of fish that can be caught in particular parts of the seas around Europe.
