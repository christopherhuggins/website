This project, which formed the basis of my PhD, examined the transnational European networking activities undertaken by local autorities in England and France, contributing to the understanding of multilevel governance and local level Europeanisation processes. It sought to answer three questions:

  * What is the extent of transnational networking?
  * What are the motivations of the local authorities involved?
  * How effective are local authorities engaging in transnational networking?

The project focused on the transnational networking activities of 14 local authorities in South East England and Northern France. It drew on interviews with 68 local politicains and officials and an analysis of over 100 local government documents and policy reports.
