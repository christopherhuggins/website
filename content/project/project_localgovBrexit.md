This project, which is currently in progress, examines the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union on local government in England. There are three strands to this research:

  1. What opportunities and challenes does Brexit present local authorities?
  2. How are local authorities mobilising to influence the UK government's approach to Brexit?
  3. What impact will Brexit have on the constitutional status of local authorities and their future relationships with the UK government and the EU?
