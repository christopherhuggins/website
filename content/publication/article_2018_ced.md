abstract = "Brexit presents English local authorities with significant uncertainties. This is particularly the case with EU regional policy, which, in a context of political centralization and budgetary pressures, has become an important means for local authorities to undertake projects in their local areas. While local authorities were relatively quiet during the referendum campaign, there is now concern about the long-term future and availability of regional policy support. This article offers an initial survey of local authorities’ role during the campaign and their attempts to influence post-Brexit regional policy. It shows that local authorities’ attempts to engage in these debates, both before and after the referendum campaign, have been hampered by inherent centralization in the English political system."
