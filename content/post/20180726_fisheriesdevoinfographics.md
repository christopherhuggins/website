Part of [our project](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexitresearch/uk-fisheries-policy-post-brexit-multi-level-challenges-and-opportunities/) on the impact of Brexit on UK fisheries policy explores how the devolution settlement might be affected when the UK leaves the Common Fisheries Policy. This devolution question is important for a number of reasons, which I cover in a [recent blog post](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/blog/why-devolution-matters-fisheries-policy) for the Centre on Constitutional Change. One of these reasons is fundamental difference in the nature of the fishing industry across the UK's four nations.

To help illustrate this, I'm slowly putting together a series of infographics on the nature of the fishing industry in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

## 1: Differences in fishing fleet composition across the UK
