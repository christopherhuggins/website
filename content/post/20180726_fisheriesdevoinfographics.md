Part of [our project](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/brexitresearch/uk-fisheries-policy-post-brexit-multi-level-challenges-and-opportunities/) on the impact of Brexit on UK fisheries policy explores how the devolution settlement might be affected when the UK leaves the Common Fisheries Policy. This devolution question is important for a number of reasons, which I cover in a [recent blog post](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/blog/why-devolution-matters-fisheries-policy) for the Centre on Constitutional Change. One of these reasons is fundamental difference in the nature of the fishing industry across the UK's four nations.

To help illustrate this, I'm slowly putting together a series of infographics on the nature of the fishing industry in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

2. [Weight and value of fish landings across the UK](#2-weight-and-value-of-fish-landings-across-the-uk).
3. [Top 10 species landed into UK ports](#3-top-10-species-landed-into-uk-ports).
4. [Internal boundaries of the UK's EEZ](#4-internal-boundaries-of-the-uks-eez).

## Q and A

### Where does the data come from?
The data on fishing vessels and landings comes from the [Marine Management Organisation](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation/about/statistics). They publish a range of great statistics on fisheries - their [annual sea fisheries statistics publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sea-fisheries-annual-statistics) is well worth a read if you want to get an overview of fisheries.

The NUTS2 boundaries used in the second infographic come from [Eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts).

The EEZ boundaries in the fourth infographic come from [MarineRegions.org](http://www.marineregions.org/), while the boundaries of the Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales zones come from the UK Hydrographic Office's [INSPIRE Portal](http://aws2.caris.com/ukho/mapViewer/map.action).

### How did you make the infographics?
I used R to analyse the data and make the graphs. If you're into that sort of thing, you can see my (rather cumbersome) code on [GitHub](https://github.com/christopherhuggins/fisheries_devo_infographics). I then played around with the layout in PowerPoint until it all looked OK. The map in the fourth infographic was made using QGIS.

### Can I use the infographics in my own work?
Yes. But please provide attribution.
