abstract = {This article evaluates changes in teaching delivery during the first year of an undergraduate Tourism Management degree programme at a university in the North West of England. Moving from traditional semesterised mode, delivery was changed to shortened, time-intensive modules delivered one at a time, for two full days (six hours per day) over a three-week period. This was implemented in response to student feedback and concerns regarding student outcomes. Albeit limited, previous research suggests that intensive forms of delivery can improve engagement, attendance and attainment, particularly amongst students from diverse entry pathways. Although it is clear that the efficacy of block teaching relies heavily on – and creates new pressures for – teaching staff, little research has explored those impacts. Here instead, the perceptions of teaching staff were the focus. A qualitative approach was taken using an anonymous, online questionnaire, completed following one full year of block teaching. Findings suggest that, although most lecturers found that block teaching enabled them to manage their time more effectively, as the year progressed, block teaching negatively affected student attendance and subsequently hampered deep learning. Fully-integrated placement of assessment and use of one intensive module to aid transition was recommended to help overcome these issues.}

abstract = {One response to the global trend of increasing rates of student participation in tertiary education has been for universities to increase the number of intensive mode of delivery subjects available. This phenomenon extends to science subjects. Embarking on offering an undergraduate science subject in intensive mode for the first time at the Australian case example university, it was essential to first learn about good pedagogical design and practice from other educational organisations. To achieve this, a website audit of Australian universities was undertaken in tandem with a critical review of the Australian and international literature on intensive mode of delivery. While it was found that a majority of Australian universities offer science subjects in intensive mode, these subjects were primarily at the postgraduate level of study. The literature focusing on intensive mode in science was minimal. It revealed definitional ambiguity and conceptual non-uniformity as well as a range of positive, negative and inconclusive results in relation to the academic and ‘real-world’ outcomes of intensive mode. This review identifies a need for evidenced-based empirical research into the pedagogy around intensive mode for undergraduate science subjects.}

abstract = {This paper aims to provide a first evaluation of the University of Bedfordshire Business School’s innovative attempt to develop a new suite of Masters Programmes that delivers in terms of academic rigor and employability requirements while providing a rich student learning experience. The new delivery is based on a block delivery model that rationalises the previous offerings by providing a smaller range of standardized large units which are more tightly integrated to each other and are part of courses with particular characteristics such as a four-tier induction system (with inductions being progressively more employability focused as students’ progress from one unit to the next) and the final capstone unit where students have a choice between a traditional dissertation and an experiential final project. That common architecture is coupled with a flipped classroom delivery style, utilization of blended learning and rich peer-to-peer learning opportunities with multiple entry points providing additional students into the cohorts for each unit. Preliminary data is provided here as an early evaluation of the approach’s effectiveness and efficiency in terms of the delivery experience, the assessment strategies, the levels of student engagement and performance, as well as the experience of staff and students.}

abstract = {The present study investigated differences in the effectiveness of instructors from a variety of departments who taught the same course in both intensive and traditional formats within the same year, while controlling for many confounding variables. Results indicated that intensive courses did not significantly differ from traditional courses in overall instructor ratings on student evaluations of teaching effectiveness when confounding variables were taken into account. Conversely, intensive courses received significantly higher overall course ratings on student evaluations than did traditional courses, even after controlling for class size and probable grade in course. These findings provide further evidence that negative beliefs concerning intensive courses may be unjustified, and intensive courses may be as or more effective than those presented in traditional formats.}

abstract = {A multidisciplinary Australian University introduced a block model of blended, sequential 4-week blocks to first-year students. This natural experiment compares the inaugural block and two prior cohorts on satisfaction and performance (n = 15,989 satisfaction and n = 86,545 assessment observations). Mixed effect cross-classified models with comprehensive controls, moderation and sensitivity testing show substantial increases in performance, especially for equity groups important in an expanding sector: low-socio-economic and prior academic achievement, non-English-speaking background. Effects on satisfaction were small with increases in teaching satisfaction but decrement in course satisfaction, especially perceived reasonable workload. Discipline consistently moderated effects and units that redesigned assessments offset some decline in course satisfaction. New models of higher education may support improved outcomes.}

Based on survey data from approximately 29,000 students, on average students spent about 17 minutes more per credit per week on 16-week courses than on similar 8-week courses. For selected general education courses taught in both formats, a similar result was obtained. When disaggregating results by subject and instructor, we found that the subject and the instructor of the course are more likely to be the cause of any significant difference in rigor based on workload.}

abstract = {Intensive mode teaching (IMT) involves students participating in classes or facilitated learning activities on fewer days and for longer each day than is traditional for the discipline. The mode has been used for many years in disciplines in which classes are structured to accommodate practical experience, such as education and health, and in courses where many students work full time, such as Masters courses in business and law (Davies, 2006). In the 21st century, IMT is used for staff to teach in blocks at offshore and regional campuses. The convenience of the mode has increased, with technology now providing opportunities for students to access information, learning activities, assessments, and peers and teachers outside class. The mode inherently raises concerns about whether students have time to learn, with classes on fewer days than traditionally. Despite the increasing popularity of IMT, until now knowledge about understanding how to teach in the mode was scarce. This project aimed to promote and support improved student experiences of learning in units (also known as courses or papers) that involve IMT. The project made the only recent study of the student experience of IMT in multiple units and disciplines. An IMT guide with sector-wide relevance was developed, disseminated, implemented, and tested.}

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the practices and challenges of modular/block teaching in higher education institutions of Ethiopia. A descriptive survey design was used with instructors and students. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to gather data and analysed quantitatively (descriptive and inferential statistics) and qualitatively (thematic analysis). The results showed variations in practice across different universities. It was found that modular/block teaching helps students to concentrate on one subject at a time but does not place emphasis on practical skills; this means that the theory and practice of the theory stay separate, which does not make learning credible. Additionally, it was found that due to the limited time given for one course, it was difficult to implement active learning. Generally, instructors and students faced challenges in the practice of modular/block teaching. Practically, the authors have made suggestions for the better implementation of modular/block teaching.}

abstract = {In an attempt to transform the first-year student experience, Victoria University adopted a Block Teaching Model. Under this 3.5 weeks-long intensive setting for a physics unit, face-to-face sessions were complemented with various blended learning initiatives, including interactive HTML5 (H5P) rich video presentations, an open-access electronic textbook, and online simulations and quizzes. A strong correlation between student performance in assessment tasks and participation in corresponding blended learning activities was discovered. Similar findings were obtained by analysing gain in student conceptual understanding. These results clearly showcase how technology enabled learning can enhance student performance in an intensive block mode teaching setting.}
